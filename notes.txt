Notes

Important:  This program will search from a given folder down through the file system looking for sub-folders containing TIFF files
            Once the folder is processed, ALL Tiff files in the folder will be converted
            Needless to say, if you select a crazy folder, the program will do exactly what its meant to do and process it
            If said crazy folder has no Tif Files, nothing will happen.   If it does, they will all be converted and moved to
            new folders - this might be undesirable or a calamity depending on the folder you choose....


- Do NOT use 'TIFF Images' as a folder name (or portion of folder name) as these folders will be skipped.
- You cannot process the same folder twice - already processed folders will be skipped
- You can add new customer folders into a folder with already processed customer folders - only the new ones will be processed
- You can update an already processed customer folder to, for example, add another box of scans, only the newly added sub-folder will be processed

- Files in the selected root folder will be processed
- Files in the root of the customer folder will be processed


** DO NOT used dots/periods/fullstops in filenames except in the suffix.   file.jpg is fine, file.1.jpeg is NOT !
